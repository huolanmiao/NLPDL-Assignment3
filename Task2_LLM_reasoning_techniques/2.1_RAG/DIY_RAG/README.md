query = "What is the Sutton's opinion on AI research at that time?"  

answer = "Rich Sutton's opinion on AI research at that time is that general methods leveraging computation are ultimately the most effective. He argues that while researchers often seek to leverage human knowledge for short-term improvements, the long-term focus should be on leveraging computation due to Moore's law. This approach tends to complicate human-knowledge methods, making them less suited for general computational methods."
